                <h1>ABOUT</h1>
                <br>
                <p>My name is Brendan Walsh. I am a student at Michigan State University who is studying computer science and game design.
                    For the longest time, I have been interested in technology, and more specifically, video games. In high school, I decided
                    that I wanted to try my hand at game development and set out to learn the required skills to do so. I started teaching myself
                    several relevant pieces of game development, such as 3D modeling, level design, and of course, programming.
                    The language I started out with was Python, and I was instantly captivated. I made simple text games at first and kept building up my skills from there.
                    I then moved on to messing around with game engines, such as Unity, Unreal, and Source. I began taking courses for computer science and game design
                    at my high school. I knew that I had found my passion and my path in life, and it was to become programmer.
                    Over the years, I have worked on many projects, both in school and out of school, I have attended many hackathons, I have done all I can to further
                    my knowledge in this amazing field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several years have passed since I chose to become a programmer, and I am now a senior at Michigan State University. Soon I will enter the real world and 
                    begin putting my skills to use. I hope that I can make the world a better place, and that I can continue to learn even more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website was built as a means of teaching myself web design. I had some basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript before, but I never really got deep into it,
                    until now.
                </p>
                <p>Also, you may be wondering "Beedzo? What's a Beedzo?" Well... it was my childhood nickname.</p>

                    <p>A Wheel of Fortune style graphical selection wheel. 
                        The user spins it, and it will eventually come to a stop on an item on the wheel. 
                        The user can add or delete items from the wheel, as well as spin it. 
                        Items that are added are stored in a local SQLite database, so they are loaded again when the user closes and reopens the program.</p>

                    <h1>Wingman From the Other Side</h1>
                    <p>Voted as one of the most innovative game projects of MI445 in Fall semester 2019, Wingman from the Other Side is a
                        physics based puzzle game built with Unity engine. You play as Laramie the ghost, whose job is to possess
                        objects in each level to bring a couple together. I provided a lot of the underlying C# programming for the
                        game's systems, and also helped with various other aspects of the game. I particularly enjoyed working on this game, and had a great experience with the team I worked
                        on it with.

                    <p>Cretaceous Companion is a game I helped create in my Intro to Game Design and Development class. 
                        I mostly handled programming but helped out in various other aspects of the game as well. 
                        This was the second group project of the class, and of the 8 games submitted by the whole class, was voted to be the most fun game. 
                        Cretaceous Companion was also chosen as an "Outstanding Game Project" in Fall 2019.</p>
